To begin with the board is empty. &#10;2. Players decide who will be white by tossing a coin. Traditionally white goes first. &#10;3. At each turn a player places one of their counters on one of the points on the board. &#10;4. Each player aims to make &quot;mills&quot; which are vertical or horizontal lines of three counters in a row. &#10;5. When a player makes a mill, they can remove one of their opponent's pieces. &#10;6. Players take turns to play a piece of their own colour on any unoccupied point until all eighteen pieces have been played.&#10;7. A piece in a mill may only be removed if the opponent has no other pieces available outside mills.&#10;8. When all pieces have been placed, in each turn the player can move one piece along a line to an adjacent point. &#10;9.Captured pieces are never replayed onto the board and remain captured for the remainder of the game. &#10;10. When a player is reduced to three pieces, they may “fly” any piece to any vacant point on the board, not only adjacent points.&#10;11. The game is finished when a played loses, either by having only two pieces left or by being unable to move" wrapText="true">
